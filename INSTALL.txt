Installing lxml
===============

Requirements:

* libxml 2.2.16 (newer versions should work). It can be found here:
  http://xmlsoft.org/downloads.html

* libxslt 1.1.12 (newer versions should work). It can be found here:
  http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/downloads.html

You also need Pyrex (0.9.3) to compile the software. It can be found
here:

* http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/

You also need Python 2.3 (Python 2.4 also ought to work).

Type::

  python setup.py install

to compile and install the library.

It's also possible to do this::

  python2.3 setup.py  build_ext -i

or just::

  make

This will not install lxml, but if you place lxml's "src" on your
PYTHONPATH somehow, you can import it and play with it.
