Things to try out when life permits
===================================

* generating XML using the ``with`` statement

  http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.general/579950?set_lines=100000

* parse-time validation against a user provided DTD

  * currently only works for XML Schema

* somehow integrate RelaxNG compact notation (rnc versus rng)

  * currently not supported by libxml2 (patch exists)

* support subclassing XSLTAccessControl to provide custom per-URL
  access check methods

  * maybe custom resolvers are enough, or can be combined with this?
