Some code, such a selftest.py, src/lxml/_elementpath.py and
src/lxml/tests/test_elementtree_doctests are derived from
ElementTree. See doc/licenses/elementtree.txt for the license text.

test.py, the test-runner script, is GPL and copyright Shuttleworth
Foundation. See doc/licenses/GPL.txt. It is believed the unchanged
inclusion of test.py to run the unit test suite falls under the
"aggregation" clause of the GPL and thus does not affect the license
of the rest of the package.
