Documentation
-------------

lxml follows the `ElementTree API`_ as much as possible, building it
on top of the native libxml2 tree. See also the `ElementTree
compatibility overview`_.

lxml also `extends this API`_ to expose libxml2 and libxslt specific
functionality, such as XPath_, `Relax NG`_, `XSLT`_, and
`c14n`_. There is also more `detailed information`_ about what's
possible with XPath.
