Features
--------

* Changed setup.py so that library_dirs is also guessed. This should
  help with compilation on the Mac OS X platform, where otherwise the
  wrong library (shipping with the OS) could be picked up.

* Tweaked setup.py so that it picks up the version from version.txt.

Bugs
----

* Do the right thing when handling namespaced attributes.

* fix bug where tostring() moved nodes into new documents. tostring()
  had very nasty side-effects before this fix, sorry!

0.5.1 (2005-04-09)
==================

* Python 2.2 compatibility fixes.

* unicode fixes in Element() and Comment() as well as XML(); unicode
  input wasn't properly being UTF-8 encoded.
