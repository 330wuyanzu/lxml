==============

under development
-----------------

* Tweaked setup.py so that it picks up the version from version.txt.

* Changed setup.py so that library_dirs is also guessed. This should
  help with compilation on the Mac OS X platform, where otherwise the
  wrong library (shipping with the OS) could be picked up.

0.5.1 (2005-04-09)
------------------

* Python 2.2 compatibility fixes.

* unicode fixes in Element() and Comment() as well as XML(); unicode
  input wasn't properly being UTF-8 encoded.

0.5 (2005-04-08)
----------------

Initial public release.
