lxml.etree versus ElementTree
=============================

A lot of care has been taken to ensure compatibility between etree and
ElementTree. Nonetheless, some differences and incompatibilities exist:

* Importing etree is obviously different; etree uses a lower case
  package name, while ElementTree a combination of upper-case and
  lower case in imports::

  # etree
  from lxml.etree import Element

  # ElementTree
  from elementtree.ElementTree import Element

  When switching over code from ElementTree to etree, and you're using
  the package name prefix 'ElementTree', you can do the following::

  # instead of
  from elementtree import ElementTree
  # use
  from lxml import etree as ElementTree

* ElementTree has a bug when serializing an empty Comment (no text
  argument given) to XML, etree serializes this successfully.

* When trying to set a subelement using __setitem__ that is in fact
  not an Element but some other object, etree raises a TypeError, and
  ElementTree raises an AssertionError.

* ElementTree ignores comments when parsing XML, while etree will read
  them in and treat them as Comment elements.
