lxml.etree versus ElementTree
=============================

A lot of care has been taken to ensure compatibility between etree and
ElementTree.

Differences:

* import is different; etree uses a lower case package name, while
  ElementTree a combination of upper-case and lower case::

  # etree
  from lxml.etree import Element

  # ElementTree
  from elementtree.ElementTree import Element

  When switching over code from ElementTree to etree, and you're using
  the package name prefix 'ElementTree', you can do the following::

  # instead of
  from elementtree import ElementTree
  # use
  from lxml import etree as ElementTree

* ElementTree has a bug when serializing an empty Comment (no text
  argument given).

* When trying to set a subelement using __setitem__ that is in fact
  not an Element but some other object, etree raises a TypeError, and
  ElementTree raises an AssertionError.

* ElementTree ignores comments upon parsing, while etree treats them in
  as Comment elements.
