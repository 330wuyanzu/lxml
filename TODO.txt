lxml
====

* sharing the same libxml2 tree between DOM and etree. This will
  require a revision of the nodecache system, so that nodecaches can
  be more globally shared, and multiple types of nodes can be
  registered in it.

* XPath query support

* XSLT support

* Relax NG validation support

* better c18n support

etree
=====

In general
----------

* test namespaces more in-depth

* will namespaces nodes of unknown namespaces be added (and never freed?)

Top level
---------

* parse() support for custom parsers.

* ProcessingInstruction

* XMLID

ElementInterface
-----------------

* use optimized find*() methods from cElementTree

* improve getiterator() implementation to use Python-level iterators

ElementTree
-----------

* _setroot()

* parse() - this is hard to implement sanely.

* improve write() support
