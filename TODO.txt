ToDo's for lxml
===============

lxml
====

Exposing libxml2 functionalities
--------------------------------

* Test XML entities, also in an ElementTree context.


In general
----------

* test namespaces more in-depth

* will namespace nodes of unknown namespaces be added (and never freed?)

* more testing on multi-threading

* better exception messages for XPath and schemas based on error log,
  e.g. missing namespace mappings in XPath


ElementTree
-----------

* _setroot(), even though this is not strictly a public method.


QName
-----

* expose prefix support?


Objectify
---------

* emulate setting special __attributes__ on ObjectifiedElement's as Python
  attributes, not XML children


Features
--------

* RelaxNG compact notation (rnc versus rng) support.  Currently not supported
  by libxml2 (patch exists)


lxml 2.0
========

* print column number in error log lines

* clean up (and remove?) duplicated API for extension functions
